        <div className="max-w-4xl text-gray-300 space-y-6 leading-relaxed">
            <p>Welcome to A2Z, the ultimate platform for students to navigate their academic journey. Our mission is to create a transparent and collaborative educational ecosystem where students can share real experiences, discover valuable resources, and make informed decisions about their studies.</p>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white pt-4">Our Vision</h2>
            <p>We believe that learning is a shared journey. In an age of abundant information, the most valuable insights often come from peers who have walked the path before you. A2Z was born from the idea that every student's experience, whether a triumph or a challenge, is a lesson that can empower others.</p>
            <p>We aim to be the central hub for academic life, connecting students from A to Zâ€”from their first introductory course to their final specialization. By fostering a community built on trust and authentic reviews, we help you learn smarter, together.</p>
